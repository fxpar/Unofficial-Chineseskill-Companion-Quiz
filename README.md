## Purpose
The questions about pin1yin1 characters have been removed from the new version of the Chineseskill app. 

This companion quiz insists in:
* pinyin with number tones
* character stroke questions

## Help

![Question Settings](/screenshots/questionSettings.png)

* **Learning mode**: shows the answer when asking the question
* **click after wrong**: when you make a mistake, you can choose to click to go to the next question, instead of having the 5 second timer
* **random**: does not actually work (sorry!)


![Hanzi Character Settings](/screenshots/hanziCharacterSettings.png)

* **show outline**: if you want to see the outline of the character in the quiz
* **character question**: decide if the writing question ask for
** only the first character
** all the characters (might be long in a sentence)
** last character
* **size**: you can increase the character writing

![Question list](/screenshots/questions.png)

* **number of quesions**: shows the total of questions corresponding to the "checked" tags
* **start**: sometimes a tag contains a lot of questions... if you want to start at a certain question
* **tags**: check the tags that you want to be interrogated

## Todo
[ ] have a setting to decide timer after for getting to the next question
[ ] have a timed answer
[ ] make random question work
